# We need to perform some linker tomfoolery in order to successfully compile
# runc for running on a BOSH VM. runc systemd support requires dynamic linking.
#
# We could modify the dynamic linker path settings of the machine as a whole or
# add our libraries to the machine's pool. We're not ok with this because this
# will interfere with other jobs on the machine which is unacceptable.
#
# Typically, you can set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable which will
# modify the linker's search path in any programs which have that environment
# variable present. Unfortunately this does not work in this case because runc
# re-execs itself with an empty environment which causes the child process to
# crash because it cannot find the libraries to link against.
#
# Instead we add an attribute in the binary to tell the linker where to find
# libraries whenever this binary is executed. We feel this is acceptable
# because we have such tight control over the execution environment in our
# deployments.
#
# The path we set is different from the current package path because we
# eventually move the binary and libraries before running them, as part of bpm
# packaging.
# 
# The runc Makefile has a parameter for modifying the linker options but it is
# broken in the case that Git is not installed on the system because of quoting
# mishaps.
