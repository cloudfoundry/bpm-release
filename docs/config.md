# Configuration Format

## Example `monit` Configuration

bpm still sits on top of `monit` as part of the current BOSH job API. However,
the contents of the `monit` file become simpler and less variable. BOSH would
like to remove support for `monit` eventually and so reducing the exposed
feature area will make this easier.

```
check process server
  with pidfile /var/vcap/sys/run/bpm/server/server.pid
  start program "/var/vcap/jobs/bpm/bin/bpm start server"
  stop program "/var/vcap/jobs/bpm/bin/bpm stop server"
  group vcap

check process worker
  with pidfile /var/vcap/sys/run/bpm/server/worker.pid
  start program "/var/vcap/jobs/bpm/bin/bpm start server -p worker"
  stop program "/var/vcap/jobs/bpm/bin/bpm stop server -p worker"
  group vcap
```

## Job Configuration

Your job configuration must be in a file called `bpm.yml` in the `config`
directory of your job.

*Note: The volumes in additional volumes must have a path inside `/var/vcap`. If
you need to mount a volume outside these paths then you must use the
`unrestricted_volumes` key.

The `unrestricted_volumes` stanza can include globs in the `path` attribute.
These globs will be evaluated by BPM on startup and each glob match will be
created as a new volume with the options specified. Please take care when using
this feature not to have your glob match too many different paths. Each mount
carries some overhead and it's possible to write a glob which could feasibly
recursively mount every single path in a directory as a different mount. We're
likely to add some reduction in the future in order to get a minimal equivalent
set of mounts but for now the mounting is very naive.

This feature was added to allow jobs which pulled configuration from all jobs
on the system to be able to do so without mounting the entire jobs directory
(which contains most if not all credentials on the system).

```yaml
# bad (will match thousands of things, just mount the directory)
unsafe:
  unrestricted_volumes:
  - path: /var/vcap/data/thing/**/*

# good (specific, needed to get around the unknown job paths)
unsafe:
  unrestricted_volumes:
  - path: /var/vcap/jobs/*/config/indicators.yml
```

### Example

```yaml
# /var/vcap/jobs/server/config/bpm.yml
processes:
- name: server
  executable: /var/vcap/data/packages/server/serve.sh
  args:
  - --port
  - 2424

  env:
    FOO: BAR

  limits:
    processes: 10

  ephemeral_disk: true

  additional_volumes:
  - path: /var/vcap/data/sockets
    writable: true

  capabilities:
  - NET_BIND_SERVICE

- name: worker
  executable: /var/vcap/data/packages/worker/work.sh
  args:
  - --queues
  - 4

  additional_volumes:
  - path: /var/vcap/data/sockets
    writable: true

  hooks:
    pre_start: /var/vcap/jobs/server/bin/worker-setup
```

## Setting Sysctl Kernel Parameters

We recommend setting these parameters in your BOSH `pre-start` with the
following command:

```bash
sysctl -e -w net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout 10
sysctl -e -w net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse 1
```

You could set these in your bpm `pre_start` but since these affect the entire
host and not just the contained job we like to keep them separate.

## Passing Configuration at Runtime

You are also able to pass volumes to mount and environment variables into the
process when using `bpm run`. This is useful to mount volumes and pass
configuration which you don't know about until runtime.  The syntax for this
is:

```
bpm run -v /var/vcap/data/database:writable,allow_executions -v ... [...]
```

```
bpm run -e KEY=value -e ... [...]
```

**Note:** The environment variable flag should not be used for secret values as
these strings will appear in the process table.

The both flags can be specified multiple times. The volume flag can use the
`writable`, `mount_only`, or `allow_executions` options.

The same validations and limitations which apply to the file-based
configuration also apply here.

## Hooks

Your startup hook must finish with time to spare before the `monit start`
timeout (30s by default). We're looking into ways to make this less vague.

## Privileged Jobs

Processes can be marked as privileged by setting the `unsafe: {privileged:
true}` attribute in their configuration. Jobs should almost never use this
configuration option as it was only added for jobs which truly need to run as a
superuser such as Garden.

Running a privileged job removes some of the safeguards which surround a bpm
process. The full list of the effects is as follows:

* runs as user `root` and group `root`
* grants a larger list of privileges (taken from docker's privileged list)
* allows new privileges to be gained
* removes seccomp limitations
* removes masked and readonly paths (still applies to volumes and
  `/var/vcap/{data,store}`)
* all mounts have their nosuid option removed
